My research focuses on probabilistic modeling and spatial statistics to better understand complex systems. I am particularly interested in applying Bayesian inference and stochastic processes to analyze environmental and economic data.\n\nI am currently developing probabilistic models for presence-only data, designed to answer questions about the magnitude and effect of environmental variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
