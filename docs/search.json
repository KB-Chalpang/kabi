    "text": "This is a space where I share my work and ideas at the intersection of ecology, statistics, and econometrics. My research focuses on applying Bayesian and probabilistic modeling techniques to real-world data, particularly in the context of ecological systems and environmental change. I’m especially interested in how we can account for uncertainty, bias, and incomplete observations—challenges that are common in both ecological and social science data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA major part of my work involves analyzing citizen science datasets, such as those from iNaturalist and PlantNet, which offer valuable insights into species distributions but require careful statistical treatment due to their presence-only nature. Alongside ecological applications, I also explore econometric approaches to survey data, where issues like sampling design, missing data, and model specification play a critical role in extracting meaningful conclusions. \n\n\n\n© 2025 Kabiru Abubakari · Email · QMUL · Kew Gardens Don’t lose hope, nor be sad."

    "text": "Kabiru Abubakari\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a Ph.D student in Mathematical Sciences at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), affiliated with the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. My research, supervised by Professor Silvia Liverani, Professor Andrew Leitch, and Dr Ilia J. Leitch, focuses on Bayesian spatial modelling for biodiversity.\nMy academic journey began with a degree in Economics at the University for Development Studies (UDS) in Tamale, Ghana, where I graduated in 2020. Afterward, I served as a teaching and administrative assistant in the Department of Economics as part of my national service. Working closely with Professor Haruna Issahaku, Professor Paul Kwame Nkegbe, and Professor Kojo Stanley Dary was an inspiring experience that led to my first steps into academic research and writing.\nI went on to pursue a Master’s degree at the University of Burgundy Europe (UBE) in Dijon, France. During this time, I also completed a two-month internship at ECONRES at the Autonomous University of Madrid (AUM) in Madrid, Spain. There, I worked with Professor Coro Chasco and Professor Julie Le Gallo on structural equation modelling — an experience that further deepened my interest in research at the intersection of economics and statistics.\nMy Ph.D work brings together statistical modelling, and ecology to develop methods that better capture uncertainty in biodiversity data. I am especially interested in Bayesian approaches, spatial statistics, and their applications in understanding economic and ecological data.\n\n\n\n\n© 2025 Kabiru Abubakari · Email · QMUL · Kew Gardens Don’t lose hope, nor be sad."
