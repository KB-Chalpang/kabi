<!-- I am a PhD student interested in econometrics and statistical ecology. My research focuses on probabilistic modeling and spatial statistics to model complex data. Data generated by economic and ecological agents are susceptible to many biases and measurement errors. Econometric and ecological models must be adjusted to account for these biases to obtain consistent parameter estimates. I am developing Bayesian models for presence-only data, often encountered in ecology.-->

<!-- Welcome to my website
I am a Ph.D student at Queen Mary University of London ([QMUL](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/)), and also affiliated to the Royal Botanical Gardens ([KEW](https://www.kew.org/)). I work with [Professor Silvia Liverani](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/liveranis.html), [Professor Andrew Leitch](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/andrewleitch.html) and [Dr Ilia J Leitch](https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/people/ilia-j-leitch) on the project Bayesian spatial modelling for biodiversity. Here I intend to give an overview of my academic journey ...

I completed my undergraduate degree in economics in 2020 from the University for Development Studies ([UDS](https://uds.edu.gh/)) located in Tamale, Ghana. I had a wonderful opportunity of working in the economics department as a teaching and administrative assistant for a year as a national service personnel.  During my time in the economics department I had pleasure of working with Professor Haruna Issahaku who was my thesis supervior, Professor Paul Kwame Nkegbe and Professor Kojo Stanley Dary who had a profound influence on me during my national service. My interactions with these professors for the year of working in the department led to some interesting papers which I am very excited about, it was a good introduction to the world of research and academic writing. 

As I was finishing my national service with the help of Professor Paul Kwame Nkegbe I was able to secure some grants to pursue my masters degree at the University of Burgundy now called University of Burgundy Europe ([UBE](https://www.ube.fr/en/home/)) in Dijon, France. During my time at the UBE I had a two months internship opportunity with [ECONRES](https://econresuam.wordpress.com/interns/) situated at the Autonomous University of Madrid ([AUM](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio)). On this internship opportunity I had the pleasure of working with [Professor Coro Chasco](https://corochasco.wordpress.com/) and [Professor Julie Le Gallo](https://sites.google.com/site/legallopage/home) on Structural Equation Modelling, which was a beautiful experience.

I am a Ph.D student in Mathematical Sciences at [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/), affiliated with the [Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew](https://www.kew.org/). My research, supervised by [Professor Silvia Liverani](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/maths/profiles/liveranis.html), [Professor Andrew Leitch](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbbs/staff/andrewleitch.html), and [Dr Ilia J. Leitch](https://www.kew.org/science/our-science/people/ilia-j-leitch), focuses on *Bayesian spatial modelling for biodiversity*.  

My academic journey began with a degree in Economics at the [University for Development Studies (UDS)](https://uds.edu.gh/) in Tamale, Ghana, where I graduated in 2020. Afterward, I served as a teaching and administrative assistant in the Department of Economics as part of my national service. Working closely with [Professor Haruna Issahaku](https://www.uds.edu.gh/staff/iharuna-0240), [Professor Paul Kwame Nkegbe](https://uds.edu.gh/staff/pnkegbe-109027), and [Professor Stanley Kojo Dary](https://ubids.edu.gh/dcobi/director-profile) was an inspiring experience that led to my first steps into academic research and writing.  

I went on to pursue a Master’s degree at the [University of Burgundy Europe (UBE)](https://www.ube.fr/en/home/) in Dijon, France. During this time, I also completed a two-month internship at [ECONRES](https://econresuam.wordpress.com/interns/) at the [Autonomous University of Madrid (AUM)](https://www.uam.es/uam/inicio) in Madrid, Spain. There, I worked with [Professor Coro Chasco](https://corochasco.wordpress.com/) and [Professor Julie Le Gallo](https://sites.google.com/site/legallopage/home) on structural equation modelling — an experience that further deepened my interest in research at the intersection of economics and statistics.  

My Ph.D work brings together statistical modelling, and ecology to develop methods that better capture uncertainty in biodiversity data. I am especially interested in Bayesian approaches, spatial statistics, and their applications in understanding economic, ecological and health data.

<!--These videos demonstrate key aspects of my work. One focuses on modeling species distributions using citizen science data like iNaturalist, highlighting the challenges of presence-only datasets. The other illustrates how Bayesian techniques can be applied in dynamic and uncertain environments—offering deeper insights into ecological processes and policy-relevant scenarios. I also explore connections with econometrics, particularly in survey data analysis, where many statistical challenges overlap.

This is a space where I share my work and ideas at the intersection of ecology, statistics, and econometrics. My research focuses on applying Bayesian and probabilistic modeling techniques to real-world data, particularly in the context of ecological systems and environmental change. I’m especially interested in how we can account for uncertainty, bias, and incomplete observations—challenges that are common in both ecological and social science data.

A major part of my work involves analyzing citizen science datasets, such as those from iNaturalist and PlantNet, which offer valuable insights into species distributions but require careful statistical treatment due to their presence-only nature. Alongside ecological applications, I also explore econometric approaches to survey data, where issues like sampling design, missing data, and model specification play a critical role in extracting meaningful conclusions. Through visualizations, tutorials, and short videos, I aim to make complex statistical methods more accessible and to demonstrate how data, when carefully modeled, can help us better understand the natural and human-influenced world.
